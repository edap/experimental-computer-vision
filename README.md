# Experimental Computer Vision

In this course we are going to cover first the principles of computer vision, and then we are going to apply them to different camera capture techniques.

## 01
Description:

Introduction to computer vision. We read through the [computer visionchapter on the ofBook](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/image_processing_computer_vision.html).

Keywords:

`getBrightness()`, image types, image containers, openCV, point processing operations, background subtraction, frame differencing

Applications:
Besides that one that come with the introductio chapter (that are in this repository), have a look at this [example on ofxCV](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv/tree/master/example-background) and the example `examples/computer-vision`.

Exercises:
- Download [ofxCV](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv/) in your `addons` folder, we will have a look to some of the examples in the next lesson.
- Take two images and perform operations with them (addition, multiplication, division). Add a GUI, add parameter that change the behaviour of your mixer. Add color picker wheel, select only certain color in the image.
